  <p>The Dactyl keyboard is a configurable ergonomic keyboard. You can not only change the switch types you are using, but the key layout and shape of the keyboard as well, so that it fits to your typing style and needs.</p>
  <p>I recommend you begin with the default preset (<span>Ergodox</span>). It has better defaults for the key holes and connector.</p>
  <p>Before 3D printing your first Dactyl Keyboard case, I recommend you:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
    <li>Copy down the current site URL so you can revisit your design. The URL is unique to the keyboard you've configured.</li>
    <li>Take a look at a few build logs online and decide whether you want to use PCBs or solder the wires directly to the switches.</li>
    <li>Find where to buy the parts necessary for the keyboard (switches, keycaps, diodes, wires, microcontrollers, cables, and soldering equipment).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There's a lot to making your own keyboard, but it's a fun process. I promise!</p>
