# SCAD Implementations

This library contains an adaptation of the Clojure SCAD library for ClojureScript.
The library is very nicely split up into an AST generation phase and an output stage.

I provide two new output options: jscad, which outputs JavaScript code, and jscadjs, which outputs javascript objets.
